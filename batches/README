====================== Melbourne Genomics Variant Calling Pipeline =======================

This directory contains batches of data and analysis results from operation of the
pipeline. Each batch is given a name, and the entire working results from 
analysis of the batch is stored in a directory with that name.

Directory structure under here:

     <batch id> : directories numbered by batch id containing source data
           - data     : source data (FastQ)
           - design   : design files relevant to this batch
           - analysis : the outputs and working files from execution of the pipeline
