Melbourne Genomics Demonstration Project Pipeline

Version 0.9.1 Release Notes

==================================================


    adding lovd export script into pipeline

    added script for importing to LOVD as part of pipeline

    use new sample meta data format

    do not exclude variants that are observed in AML patients (tumor samples)

    print more info when sample / fastq mismatch occurs

    Change CMT genes etc priority 2 based on feedback from Natalie / Ivan

    updated rules for calculating priority index:
        - allow very rare variants into priority 2 and priority 3 (MAF < 0.0005)
        - allow truncating variants into priority 1 if they are rare

    Added script for making official releases, support for tracking human-readable 
    version of pipeline, display of version in provenance report

    fix genes appearing twice when overlapping, sort by category and include in the report

    fix annotation of phx indels to be in annovar format, consistent with 
    rest of variants

    move provenance report to results directory

    ignore intergenic regions in producing QC summary

    fix het / hom appearing in incorrect column of pgx variants

    removed genes based on out of date CCDS versions - some of them were pointing to hg18 gene definitions
    added new gene tiers ( *not final* )

    - added fraction of reads on target and total number of reads to QC pdf
    - fixed variants called on too narrow target (exome target instead of
      exome + disease cohort target), or too wide target (whole genome, causing
      milliions of variants to get called, weighing down pipeline)
    - fixed Annovar conversion dropping variants for non-primary samples, causing
      missed variants in output report (moved annovar from annotating merged VCF
      to annotating each sample's individual VCF separately)

    Remove spurious printouts, clean up a bit

    add known disease cohorts to config.groovy

    fix incorrect statistics report in QC pdf
