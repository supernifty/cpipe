Usage: create_batch.sh <batch identifier> <target region identifier> <exome bed file>

1. The batch identifier should be an existing directory that you have 
   created under 'batches', already containing a data subdirectory containign 
   FASTQ files.

2. The target region identifier should be one of the predefined sub target regions 
   that is set up in the designs directory. These are the region for
   analysis within the larger exome.

3. The exome BED file defines the regions covered by the whole exome.

Example:

    ./pipeline/scripts/create_batch.sh cardiac_001 CARDIAC101 designs/CARDIAC101/CARDIAC101.bed

Note in this example, the region for analysis is the same as the whole design region
captured by the kit.
