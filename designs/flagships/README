============== BED Files Defining Flagship Target Regions ==========

This directory contains BED files that define the target region for each
flagship. The files were received from Harriet Dashnow on 14 Jan 2014.

Harriet's files were in slightly different format to that required, so
they have been processed by the script in scripts/reformat_bed_files.sh
to rename chromosomes and also to rename the files to a more friendly
(shorter) name. Additionally, they have been sorted using IGVTools
