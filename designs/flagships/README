============== BED Files Defining Flagship Target Regions ==========

This directory contains BED files that define the target region for each
flagship. The files were received from Harriet Dashnow on 14 Jan 2014.

Harriet's files were in slightly different format to that required, so
they have been processed by the script in scripts/reformat_bed_files.groovy

 - to rename chromosomes to 'chr' format
 - rename the actual files to more friendly names
 - sort the files using IGVTools
 - merge overlapping regions so there is only 1 unique
   region covering each part of the genome

============ About the BED files ===================

The flagship BED files are:

    AML.bed     
    CRC.bed     (colorectal cancer)
    CMT.bed
    EPIL.bed    (epilepsy)
    CS.bed      (childhood syndromes)

When you run a batch you need to select a target regions. If you want
to run a full exome analysis, you should select a region targeting the
whole exome. There are currently two such regions so far:

 SS_V4_UTR      Sureselect V4+UTR
 NEXTERA        Nextera NO UTR

============ About the Gene files ===================

Each target / flagship has a set of prioritised genes
associated with it. This is literally just a list of
genes in the *.genes.txt file for the flagship. These
are empty at the moment, but the pipeline requires the
the files to be present.
