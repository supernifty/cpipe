=================== Download GATK ====================

As GATK is a commercial product, you must agree to the
license terms yourself (not for non-research use, etc), 
download it and unzip it in this folder. Once unzipped, 
set the location in the config.groovy, if you are using
a different version to the default.

As a standard practise, the folders are being named as only
their version number. Eg: 2.3.9, or 2.8-1-g932cd3a.

To download GATK, visit this URL:

NOTE: for the pipeline to work with GATK 2.3.9, please edit
      config.groovy and set GATK_LEGACY=true
