=================== Download GATK ====================

As GATK is a commercial product, you must agree to the
license terms yourself (not for non-research use, etc), 
download it and unzip it in this folder. Once unzipped, 
set the location in the config.groovy.

As a standard practise, the folders are being named as only
their version number. Eg: 2.3.9, or 2.8.1-g932cd3a.
