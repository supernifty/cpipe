====================== Melbourne Genomics Variant Calling Pipeline =======================

This directory is where Annovar should be placed. Due to licensing restrictions, (Annovar
is a proprietary, commercial product), Annovar is not included. Therefore you should register
and download it yourself, so that it appears here, in the directory "2013aug23" (if you use
a different version, but you have to then modify config.groovy to reflect that).
