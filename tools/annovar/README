====================== Melbourne Genomics Variant Calling Pipeline =======================

This directory is where Annovar should be placed. Due to licensing restrictions, (Annovar
is a proprietary, commercial product), Annovar is not included. Therefore you should register
and download it yourself, so that it appears here, in the directory "2013aug23" (if you use
a different version, but you have to then modify config.groovy to reflect that).

Once Annovar is downloaded / installed, you need to download its data as well. There is 
a script to do that in <root>/pipeline/script/download_annovar_db.sh. Make sure you 
point it at the 'humandb' folder in this folder as the place to store the data, eg:

./pipeline/script/download_annovar_db.sh ./tools/annovar/2013aug23/ ./tools/annovar/humandb
