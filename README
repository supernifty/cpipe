====================== Melbourne Genomics Variant Calling Pipeline =======================

Directory structure under here:

 - pipeline : the source code for running the pipeline
              this is a checkout (clone) of the git repository 

 - batches  
     <batch id> : directories numbered by batch id containing source data
           - data     : source data (FastQ)
           - design   : symbolic link to the design directory relevant to this batch
           - analysis : the outputs and working files from execution of the pipeline

 - designs
     
    <design id / name> : BED files and other information associated with a design
                         Each sequencing run will have used a specific design file

 - hg19

   All the HG19 reference files for alignment and downstream processing.
   These are downloaded from GATK resource bundle for compatibility with GATK.
